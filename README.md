# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2024! This repository contains my attempts at solving the daily coding challenges presented in the Advent of Code 2024 event. I am using this as an opportunity to practice my Rust programming and my algorithms.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun with the programming community.

## Structure

Each day's solution will be organized in its own directory, named `dayX`, where `X` is the day of the challenge.

## Solutions
